\brief WeatherAPI Server – Integration, Architecture and FSM Approach

\section intro Introduction

The WeatherAPI Server is designed as an extension for our working time tracking environment, where multiple computers cooperate via CORBA interfaces.  
This flexible setup supports attaching various sensors and devices; for example, a Raspberry Pi can be used to provide local weather data.  
The project’s goal is to demonstrate the integration of heterogeneous technologies—CORBA, REST APIs, sensor hardware—without rigidly separating server and client roles.

\section architecture Architecture & Integration

The server is intended to access real-time sensor data from a Raspberry Pi over CORBA, analyze it, and make the results available to the system.  
In the initial implementation, it also efficiently imports publicly available weather data from the Open Meteo REST API (intended for educational use only, not for commercial purposes), supplementing or substituting the hardware data as needed.

Rather than enforcing a strict distinction between “server” and “client,” the architecture demonstrates that such roles can be fluid:  
- Both server and client components can publish or consume data.
- The system can integrate additional services or technologies—like message push mechanisms or new sensor types—without redesign.
- The WeatherAPI Server, in its final form, will leverage CORBA both for handling stateful interactions with multiple clients and for pushing asynchronous notifications (such as alerts or state changes).

\section fsm_ref FSM Design & State Management

The core data acquisition and scheduling logic is implemented as a finite state machine (FSM), following the concepts described on the related page  
\ref finite_state_machine_page "Finite State Machines and Boost.Statechart".

The state diagram below illustrates the states and transitions of the FetchWeatherMachine:

\section integration_notes Integration Notes

- This project is a proof-of-concept for flexible, loosely-coupled distributed systems that integrate legacy and modern technologies.
- Server and client functionalities are not mutually exclusive; the same component may serve both roles depending on use case.
- The design accommodates future extensions, such as new sensor types, push notifications, or alternative middleware.
